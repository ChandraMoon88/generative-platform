# EcoSphere Game Rebuild Plan

## Problem Identified
Current game is just a "click Complete Level" button with no actual gameplay. Users complete all 15 levels in minutes instead of hours. No skills required, no challenges, no engagement.

## Solution Required
Build REAL interactive gameplay for each level based on plan.txt specifications. Each level should:
- Take minimum 2-3 hours to complete
- Require strategic thinking and problem-solving
- Have interactive mini-games and challenges
- Track progress and validate completion criteria
- Unlock only after genuine completion (not just clicking)
