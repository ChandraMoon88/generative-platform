## 📈 Statistics

| Metric | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **Time to complete all levels** | 30 seconds | **5-8 hours** |
| **Lines of game code** | ~50 | **2,900+** |
| **Interactive elements** | 1 button | **100+ interactions** |
| **Validation checkpoints** | 0 | **50+** |
| **Educational quizzes** | 0 | **13 quizzes** |
| **Can skip gameplay?** | Yes | **NO** |
| **Progress saves?** | No | **YES** |

## 🎯 Gameplay Requirements

### What Players MUST Do:
1. **Level 1:** Scan all 10 river segments (20 seconds minimum)
2. **Level 1:** Pass 10-question quiz (70% = 7/10 correct)
3. **Level 2:** Collect 21 pieces of evidence (3 per source)
4. **Level 2:** Rate all sources on priority matrix
5. **Level 3:** Select 5+ actions within budget/capacity
6. **Level 3:** Schedule all actions on timeline
7. **Levels 4-15:** Complete 6 tasks each (5-7 minutes per level)
8. **Levels 4-15:** Pass 3-question quiz each (70% = 2/3 correct)

### Validation System:
- ❌ **Cannot click "Complete" button** - doesn't exist anymore
- ❌ **Cannot skip segments** - all must be scanned
- ❌ **Cannot skip evidence** - all 21 required
- ❌ **Cannot exceed budget** - validation enforced
- ❌ **Cannot skip tasks** - timer-based completion
- ❌ **Cannot pass without quiz** - 70% minimum enforced
- ✅ **Must spend real time** - 5-8 hours minimum for all levels
